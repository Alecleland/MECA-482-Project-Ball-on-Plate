1. Introduction

This project will track the balls motion on a plate and adjust its orientation accordingly so that the ball does not fall of the plate. Matlab and Simulink will used in this project and a PiD based controller will be implemented to control the system. This system will be tested in CoppeliaSim. This system is a control-based experiment that will use two servo motors that control the X/Y axis of the plate to ensure that the ball does not fall off the plate.
